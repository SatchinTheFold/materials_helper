A python helper file that takes a list of Products and will match materials in title.
It will return 4 CSV files: 
- One where there is a main material in title.
- One where there is a secondary material that matches (e.g if it finds belt in the title, replace with leather) 
- One where products have no primary/secondary material in the title and so have to be hard coded
- One where there are no matches
